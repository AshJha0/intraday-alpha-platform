# Changelog

Release notes for tagged versions, newest first. The v1.3.0 entry is written
in the repository; notes for v1.1.1 and v1.2.0 are copied from their GitHub
releases; v1.1.0 has a git tag but no GitHub release, so its entry comes from
the annotated tag message and the changes recorded in the repository for
that tag.

## Unreleased

Nothing yet.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-10-03

A review of the safety code — the hard risk engine, the execution simulator
and the Java paper platform — and of the research statistics. Five pull
requests: [#7](https://github.com/AshJha0/intraday-alpha-platform/pull/7)
risk engine, [#10](https://github.com/AshJha0/intraday-alpha-platform/pull/10)
execution simulator, [#9](https://github.com/AshJha0/intraday-alpha-platform/pull/9)
paper platform, [#8](https://github.com/AshJha0/intraday-alpha-platform/pull/8)
governance and deployment, [#12](https://github.com/AshJha0/intraday-alpha-platform/pull/12)
research validity. No golden that existed before the release was
regenerated, no wire schema changed, and the research results are what they
were: 0 PROMOTE, 24 alphas at CANDIDATE, an MVP session that loses 22.65 USD.

### Fixed

**Hard risk engine — Rust (normative), Java and Python, identical decisions
and reason text (PLATFORM_CONVENTIONS.md §11.1, API_TRADING.md §1.4)**

- *Future-stamped market data was trusted.* A mark stamped after the order
  had a negative age, which never exceeded the stale timeout, so a corrupt
  future mark was used for as long as it stayed ahead while genuine updates
  behind it were dropped as regressions. A mark stamped more than
  `stale_feed_timeout_ns` beyond the engine's event clock now rejects
  `STALE_PRICE`; a conversion rate stamped that far ahead rejects
  `FX_RATE_MISSING`. The event clock is the latest order event time the
  engine knows (this order's timestamp or the newest throttle-bucket time).
- *NaN passed float limit checks.* Every float limit comparison is now
  written so that NaN fails it. Invalid reference data (`tick_size` or
  `qty_unit` not finite and positive, empty `quote_ccy`) fails closed: Java
  and Python refuse to construct it (Java accepted `+Infinity`), and Rust
  lands the engine on `CONFIG_MISSING` for every order.
- *Integer overflow.* Position accounting and the position projection are
  checked in the symmetric i64 domain: an overflowing projection rejects
  `MALFORMED_ORDER`; a fill that cannot be booked is not applied and latches
  the GLOBAL kill. Timestamp differences (mark age, rate age, duplicate
  window, throttle elapsed) are checked and reject `MALFORMED_ORDER`. A
  `bid + ask` that leaves i64 is treated as no mark. Before, Python raised
  `OverflowError`, the Rust test profile panicked, and the Rust release
  build and Java wrapped.
- *Venue 0 (route via SOR) bypassed venue controls.* A venue-0 order now
  rejects `KILL_VENUE` while any venue kill is engaged, and
  `VENUE_DISCONNECTED` when every known venue is disconnected.
- *Audit text parity in Java.* `urgency` is printed with Rust `f64`
  `Display` semantics; kill scope ids and snapshot keys parse like
  `u16::from_str` / `u32::from_str`; the `CONFIG_MISSING` reason carries the
  reference's `invalid argument: ` prefix.

**Execution simulator — C++ (normative), Java and Python (§11.2, §14.1,
API_TRADING.md §2.4)**

- *Fills beyond displayed size.* The post-apply crossing check and the
  reopen check rebuilt their pool from the displayed opposite best on every
  event, so a resting buy 1000 @ 100 against a static ask 50 @ 100 filled 50
  on each unrelated event. The pool is now displayed minus consumed, and the
  check debits the overlay.
- *Queue tracking trusted raw events.* Tracking now runs after the book
  update and only for events the book reports `APPLIED`: a retransmitted
  duplicate or an EXECUTE for an unknown order no longer fills us.
- *Execute cap.* An applied EXECUTE trades at most the book order's
  remaining size, at the book order's side and price.
- *Cancel rule.* A CANCEL advances our queue position only when the
  cancelled order is known to be ahead of us, by the displayed size the book
  actually removed; orders that joined behind us and synthetic
  QUOTE / SNAPSHOT ids never do.

**Java paper platform (§11.4, §12.3, §12.5) and the Python MVP engine**

- *Venue kill bypass under SOR.* The pre-trade request now names the venue
  the child is actually routed to; a child that leaves for another venue is
  counted and cancelled.
- *Resume consistency.* `session_state.json` is the single commit point of a
  checkpoint and records the sha256 of its risk snapshot, verified on
  `--resume`; an interrupted checkpoint is rolled forward. The resumed
  engine's account is seeded from the restored positions (no second buy of
  the same position) and the snapshot's orphaned open orders are released.
  Every checkpoint persists cumulative total and gross P&L.
- *Shutdown hook race.* The hook only raises a stop flag and waits (10 s);
  the trading thread checkpoints at its next event boundary. New session
  state `STOPPED` (gauge value 4).
- *Admin kill dropped on a quiet feed.* A kill latches the moment it is
  accepted, is never dequeued on timeout (response `202`, a second audit
  line when applied), is drained in the order path and between realtime
  pacing slices, and requests cancels for working child orders.
- *Gap gate.* `onFeedRecovered` fires only when no venue of the instrument
  is stale — in the Java wiring and in `iap.mvp.engine`.
- *Sizing solver names.* Constants that fed `stepDecay` / `projPasses` were
  named as a step size and a patience; they and the hashed keys are renamed.
  Solver behaviour is unchanged; a paper session's `portfolio_version` hash
  value changes.

**Research (no committed number can move)**

- Cost and time stress configurations are built with `dataclasses.replace`
  instead of a four-field rebuild; a row-latency stress IC that cannot be
  computed is `null`, not NaN; the meta-label `auc_test` is `null` on a
  single-class test segment instead of 0.5.
- Documentation said 21 looks per experiment; the code records 28.

**Documentation**

- Stale MVP figures corrected against `tests/golden/expected_mvp.json`
  (3,126 shares, −0.41 bps execution cost, the fill-rate, routing and
  per-algorithm rows), which several documents had not followed after the
  2026-09-20 regeneration.

### Added

- **Risk edge golden**: `tests/golden/expected_risk_edge_decisions.json` and
  `expected_risk_edge_audit.jsonl` — eight independent scenarios, each with
  its own engine, generated by `python/tools/make_golden_risk_edge.py` and
  replayed by Rust, Java and Python.
- **Planted-signal power study**: a generator `planted` block (off by
  default; the pinned dataset is byte-identical with or without it),
  `python -m iap.research power`, and `research/power/POWER_REPORT.{md,json}`.
- **Opt-in research methods**, each beside its pinned default
  (docs/RESEARCH_VALIDITY.md): `stress_version=2`; the cost-aware position
  policy; the L1 fill cap; blocked rows; square-root impact and breakeven
  capacity; the ledger-derived t threshold; the two-sample HAC drift z and
  the CUSUM retirement rule; the recompute leakage probe; the blackout-reopen
  IC; meta-label `impute_nan=False`.
- **Additive statistics** read by no gate: the pooled-slope HAC t,
  per-instrument and vol-scaled IC, per-fold diagnostics, a seeded
  stationary-bootstrap interval for net P&L.
- **Research store safe for parallel writers**: ledger lock file with a
  locked read-modify-write and atomic replace; run-directory creation as the
  atomic claim; staged experiment directories; listings that skip and report
  corrupt directories.
- **Gate eligibility**: `eligibility.json` beside each new result;
  lifecycle research gates refuse evidence that is not eligible.
- **Research CLI for tools**: `list --json`, `show --json`, `--json-errors`
  with stable codes; `python -m iap.store sql` refuses several statements.
- **Import-policy test** (`python/tests/test_import_policy.py`): no module of
  the guarded Python packages imports a network or LLM client.
- **Paper platform**: per-operator admin tokens (`IAP_ADMIN_TOKENS_FILE`),
  `operator` and `remote` in the admin audit, safety counters
  (`risk_routed_venue_mismatch_total`, `risk_resume_open_orders_released_total`,
  `exec_orders_blocked_kill_pending_total`, `admin_auth_rate_limited_total`,
  `admin_audit_suppressed_total`).
- **CI and release**: CodeQL, Dependabot configuration, a blocking C++
  ASan+UBSan job, blocking `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `ruff check`
  (correctness-only rule set, `ruff.toml`; the tree was made lint-clean for
  the release), non-blocking `pip-audit` / `cargo audit`, a
  tag-triggered release workflow (images to GHCR, build-provenance
  attestation, `release-manifest.json`).
- **Deployment**: Alertmanager (compose and Kubernetes) with a `Watchdog`
  heartbeat; NetworkPolicies for default-deny egress and an operator ingress
  rule; a separate state PVC for the Java platform and a Grafana PVC.
- **Documentation**: docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md, docs/RESEARCH_VALIDITY.md,
  docs/governance/REPO_SETTINGS.md, this changelog; new LEARN chapters,
  COOKBOOK recipes 27–35 and nine diagrams; seven backlog epics (E25–E31).

### Changed

- **`--dry-run` debits the ledger.** A dry run writes no experiment
  directory but its looks are recorded: it evaluates and prints every
  statistic, so it is a look.
- **The admin listener binds `127.0.0.1` by default.** Containers set
  `IAP_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0`; a deployment that relied on the old behaviour
  must set it.
- **Admin responses**: `202` for a latched kill, `429` after 10 failed
  authentications in a 60 s window, `503` for a withdrawn non-kill command.
- `images` CI job also runs on pull requests that touch image inputs.
- `CODEOWNERS` names `@AshJha0` (the `@iap/*` teams never existed).
- Versions: `python/pyproject.toml` 1.3.0; image references `v1.3.0`.
- Parity table: python 1562 / cpp 289 / rust 323 / java 510 tests, golden
  groups 166/68/64/104.

### Security

- Every GitHub Action is pinned to a commit SHA; runners are pinned
  (`ubuntu-24.04`); workflow permissions are `contents: read` with
  per-job additions; cargo runs `--locked`.
- Python dependencies carry bounds in `pyproject.toml` and exact versions in
  `python/requirements-ci.txt`; the Rust toolchain is pinned
  (`rust/rust-toolchain.toml`) with `overflow-checks = true` in the release
  profile; Docker base images are pinned by digest.
- Admin API: loopback bind by default, failed-authentication rate limit,
  capped audit of rejected requests, token hashes rather than tokens in the
  multi-operator file, operator and remote address in every audit line.
- Deployment: read-only root filesystem, no service-account token mounts,
  default-deny egress, loopback-only published ports in compose.

### Known limitations

- **Repository controls are files, not settings.** Branch protection,
  required checks, required reviews, Dependabot alerts and secret scanning
  are not configured; docs/governance/REPO_SETTINGS.md has the commands.
  Signed tags are a practice, not an enforced control.
- **The release workflow has never run.** It can only be exercised by a tag;
  its first run is its test. Until it has run and the manifests are pinned
  from its `release-manifest.json`, the `v1.3.0` image references are
  tag-only and no such image exists in the registry.
- **Alerts are routed but not delivered** until an operator supplies a
  webhook URL; audit logs are not shipped off-host; no image vulnerability
  scan is wired in.
- **The `STOPPED` state is not known downstream.** The session-state
  dashboard panel maps 0–3 only, and no rule refers to the value 4
  (deployment/grafana/README.md).
- **Ports implement the pinned research defaults only.** The opt-in HAC z,
  the CUSUM rule and the gate-eligibility flag exist in the Python reference
  alone; the Java and Rust lifecycle readers reject evidence carrying
  `research_gate_eligible`.
- **The import-policy test covers Python only**, and not `iap.replay`; the
  Rust, C++ and Java trees are enforced in review.
- **The edge golden does not cover every new branch.** It pins the future
  mark, the timestamp and position overflows and the venue-0 rules; the NaN
  limit comparisons, the invalid-reference-data landing and the
  future-stamped conversion rate are covered by per-language rule tests
  only. Differential fuzzing of the three engines is backlog (E31).
- **The power study is three seeds per cell.** A rate moves in steps of
  0.33; it calibrates the chain and is not a power curve.
- **The Python suite exceeds its 120 s target** (1562 tests, 319 s in CI
  under coverage).
- **`iap.__version__` still reads 1.0.0**; the package metadata says 1.3.0.
- **There is no LLM, agent or MCP code.** The agent layer is a backlog epic
  (E24, E30); what exists is the foundation it would need.
- Everything else that was out of scope remains so: real exchange data,
  measured latency, simulator calibration to live fills, book-level risk
  (E25–E28).

## v1.2.0 - Risk engine split into submodules (2026-09-27)

Follow-up to the code review that produced v1.1.1 — completes the last
deferred P1 item: splitting the safety-critical, byte-identical-port risk
engine into cohesive submodules.

**rust/risk/src/**
- `engine.rs` — core `RiskEngine` state machine (constructors, market/fill
  state-in, P&L, `check_order`)
- `limits_eval.rs` — the pinned rule-0..22 limit evaluation
- `killswitch.rs` — kill/unkill/override_loss_limit/roll_session
- `audit.rs` — audit-log emission and snapshot/restore
- wired via `mod` declarations in `lib.rs`; crate's public surface unchanged

**java/src/main/java/com/iap/risk/**
- `RiskEngine.java` — same shape as the Rust core, public methods now delegate
  to the new classes
- `LimitsEvaluator.java`, `KillSwitch.java`, `RiskAudit.java` — same-package
  classes operating on the `RiskEngine` instance
- Every public method signature on `RiskEngine` unchanged

Both splits were done as pure mechanical, line-for-line moves — no logic
changed, only visibility and cross-file glue. Verified behavior-identical by
CI, including `tests/golden`'s cross-language risk-parity fixtures
(`expected_risk_decisions.json`, `expected_risk_audit.jsonl`,
`expected_risk_snapshot.json`) — all checks passed on the first CI run.

See [PR #6](https://github.com/AshJha0/intraday-alpha-platform/pull/6).

## v1.1.1 - Supply-chain and error-handling hardening (2026-09-27)

Follow-up to a full-repo code review (PR #5).

**CI / supply chain**
- `promtool` and `kubeconform` downloads now verified against their published
  SHA256 checksums before install.
- Added report-only coverage instrumentation: `pytest-cov` (python),
  `cargo-llvm-cov` for the `risk` crate (rust), gcov/lcov (cpp). Java coverage
  intentionally deferred — no Maven/Gradle or vendored JaCoCo jar yet.
- The `images` job (4 Docker builds) now runs only on push to `main`, not on
  every PR, while remaining the required merge-to-main promotion gate.

**Error handling**
- `rust/alpha/src/fx_exposure.rs`: currency-lookup `.expect()` panics replaced
  with `Result<_, IapError>` propagation.
- `rust/risk/src/bin/make_risk_golden.rs`: ~30 `.unwrap()` calls on JSON field
  access replaced with helpers that return actionable errors naming the
  offending step and field, instead of bare panics on malformed golden-fixture
  input.

**Documentation / logging**
- `python/src/iap/experiment/tracker.py`: documented the pickle trust boundary
  on `save_model`/`load_model` (deserialization is an RCE vector — only ever
  load a `model.pkl` this platform produced locally).
- Swallowed `OSError`/`SubprocessError` in the git-metadata lookup is now
  logged at debug level instead of silently passed.

**Not included** (from the same review, intentionally deferred): splitting
`rust/risk/src/engine.rs` / `java/.../risk/RiskEngine.java` into submodules —
judged too risky without a local toolchain to verify zero behavioral change
against the golden risk fixtures; a `java/lib/` checksum manifest — there are
no vendored jars in the repo today.

## v1.1.0 - Round-3 hardening (2026-09-06)

Annotated tag message: "Round-3 hardening: real-world scenario correctness,
1,571 tests across four languages". No GitHub release was created for this tag.
Changes recorded in the repository for this round: real-world scenario
correctness across all four languages (`docs/SCENARIOS.md`), the CI workflow
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), the deployment validation harness
(`tests/harness/check_deployment.py`, `check_docker_build.py`), and the Java
paper-trading vertical's health, readiness and kill-switch admin API
(`PLATFORM_CONVENTIONS.md` section 12).
